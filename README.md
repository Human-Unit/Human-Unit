# üí´ About Me
I'm currently developing my **Journal Task Manager** project as a showcase for my skills.  
I use **Go** (Gin framework) and **GORM** with SQLite.  

The project architecture:  
- üõ∞Ô∏è **REST API** for endpoint connections  
- ‚ö° **gRPC** for authorization and business logic  
- üîê **JWT + bcrypt** for secure authentication  

I'm building this as a **portfolio project** while applying for **Junior Golang Developer** positions.

## üöÄ Project Highlight: Journal Task Manager
- REST (Gin) + gRPC dual-server architecture  
- Secure authentication with JWT + bcrypt  
- SQLite database with GORM ORM  
- Modular design separating endpoints and business logic  
- Used **Postman** for API testing  
- Applied **HTTP/2** with gRPC and understood its performance benefits  
- Gained knowledge of how **RESTful APIs** work and their request/response structure  
- Worked with **gRPC** and **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** for high-performance communication
